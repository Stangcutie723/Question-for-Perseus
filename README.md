Question-for-Perseus
====================
This is a web app that informally asks my boyfriend on a date night!
Accompanied by clickable choices. Originally it was just 3 files then
I went back and implemented it into ruby on rails format. Now it has 
been updated to version 0.2.21! Anyone is welcome to clone the ssh and 
run this via their terminal and on their local browser. I've used both 
firefox and chrome and it works smoothly. 
<br>
<br>
Currently on a ruby platform running rails 4.0.0. I chose to use
the amazing functions of controllers and sprucing up the CSS to 
be more easy on the eyes and yet stand out. I did not change the
javascript so those prompts are the same.

No Known Bugs:

Updates in Version 0.2.21:

Choosing options page, making your choice and the end result now all have their own links and pages.
The CSS is redone in the table and there is a new picture for the end result. Instead of 3 end result
pictures there is only one. Maybe more to come in a later version.<br>

Back Story:
=============
My boyfriend and I were both under a lot of stress regarding 
moving from one apartment to another in addition to the normal stresses like 
running errands, making dinner, completing chores, paying bills. At the time
I was also awaiting answers from a code summer camp. To break that negative cycle 
I hunkered down a couple hours a day for two weeks and created this special present for him.
<br>
His Reaction:
===============
He was really impressed with the project considering I hadn't really worked
with creating a code project before and this was my very first completed and working project. 
We did get our date! I however spoiled him; we got a movie night with both cupcakes and popcorn!<br>
