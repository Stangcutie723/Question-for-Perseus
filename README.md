Question-for-Perseus
====================
This is a web app that informally asks my boyfriend on a date night!
Accompanied by clickable choices.

(BACK STORY)My boyfriend and I were both under a lot of stress regarding 
moving from one apartment to another amongst the normal stresses like dinner, 
awaiting answers from a coding trade school and bills and what not. 
To break that negative cycle I hunkered down a couple
hours a day for two weeks and created this special present for him.

(What I used): CSS, HTML and JavaScript. <br>

(End Result): He said yes!<br>
I spoiled him; we got a movie night with both cupcakes and popcorn!<br>
