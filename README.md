Question-for-Perseus
====================
This is a web app that informally asks my boyfriend on a date night!
Accompanied by clickable choices. Originally it was just 3 files then
I went back and implemented it into ruby on rails format. I will be updaing this
as time goes on.

(BACK STORY): My boyfriend and I were both under a lot of stress regarding 
moving from one apartment to another amongst the normal stresses like dinner, 
awaiting answers from a coding trade school and bills and what not. 
To break that negative cycle I hunkered down a couple
hours a day for two weeks and created this special present for him.

(Languages Used): Ruby on Rails, CSS, Html, Javascript <br>

(How to install and run): Anyone is welcome to clone the ssh and run this via their terminal and on their local browser.
I've used both firefox and chrome and it works smoothly. 

(End Result): He said yes!<br>
I spoiled him; we got a movie night with both cupcakes and popcorn!<br>
